### Hi, I am Leon
I mainly program in C/C++ and, just for the ease, Python for Data Science. Up to now, I have successfully competed in multiple Robotics and Informatics competitions and have built many private projects. Currently I am focusing on Robotics, as well as Machine Learning and Distributed Computing.

### Current Projects
Currently, I am preparing for kaggle competitions and do general Data Science preparations, mainly statistics and SQL.
I also develop [magrad](https::/github.com/leonvol/magrad), a small scoped ML-framework, to implement the mathematical foundations of ML myself.
