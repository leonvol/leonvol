### Hi, I am Leon
I mainly program in C/C++ and, Python as well as R for Data Science, Statistics and related subjects such as Machine Learning. I am always working hard to apply my knowledge, either by successfully competing in multiple Robotics and Informatics competitions, by building private projects or by exploring real world applications in my job.

### Current Projects
Currently, I develop [magrad](https::/github.com/leonvol/magrad), a small scoped ML-framework, to implement the mathematical foundations of Machine Learning myself.
