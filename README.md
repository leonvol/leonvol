### Hi, I am Leon
I maninly program in C/C++ and, just for the ease, Python for DL. Up to now, I have successfully competed in a couple of Robotics competitions. Currently I am still focusing on Robotics, as well as Machine Learning and Distributed Computing.

### Current Projects
Furthermore, I am currently working on drone-control software, a networked Mapreduce implementation, as well as preprocessing and the model for a german-wide AI competition.
